Application main() is in com.cdl.application.CheckOutApplication

Still a bit rough and could do with a little more validation and tidy up of output
Prices and pricing rules a loaded via a static initialiser

SCANNING ITEMS
=================
App uses command pattern to perform check out The available commands are

BeginCheckOut   -start checkout session
FinishCheckOut  -finish session
ExitApp         - exit app at any time

And scan an item

ScanItem:<product code> e.g ScanItem:A  Available products as per Kata doc are A,B,C,D

example

BeginCheckOut
ScanItem:A - outputs price and subtotal
ScanItem:B
ScanItem:C
ScanItem:A

FinishCheckOut  - outputs totals

PRODUCT INSERTION
=================
There is also a basic product insert option, which inserts into the in memory price rules
Please note this is very basic and there is no validation for a product already there yet as i didn't have time :)

The commands for this are

StartUpdate  - start update session

InsertProduct:ProductId:<StockItemId>:UnitPrice:<UnitPrice>

e.g  InsertProduct:ProductId:F:UnitPrice:12

EndUpdate - end update session

e.g
StartUpdate
InsertProduct:ProductId:F:UnitPrice:12
EndUpdate

You should then be able to scan new product F via

BeginCheckOut
ScanItem:F
FinishCheckOut
