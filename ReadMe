Application main() is in com.cdl.application.CheckOutApplication

Still a bit rough and could do with a little more validation and tidy up of output
Prices and pricing rules a loaded via a static initialiser

App uses command pattern to perform check out The available commands are

BeginCheckOut   -start checkout session
